Getting started
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git​

Open the project folder in VS Code.​

Open index.html in a browser, or use the VS Code Live Server extension for auto reload.​

No build step is required; it is a static site that runs as‑is.

Replace image URLs in the #portfolio section with your own Unsplash links or local images.​

Adjust colors, typography and animations in the <style> block at the top of the file.​
